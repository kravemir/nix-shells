nix-shells
==========

Repository contains configurations for `nix-shell` to create **virtual environment** with specific software versions.

## Usage

Sometime in the far future I'll document it. In the meantime, see official documentation:

- [Development environment with nix-shell](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell)
- [Pinning in Storage optimization](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Storage_optimization#Pinning)
